# expert search

This search app allow researchers and students to upload PDF documents to a server that will recognize and extract the text for a more relevant research experience.
This app is meant to narrow down searches to a very specific and academic range, and to compliment the expert/researcher's mind rather than supplement it

## Preview

A deployed version of the app can be found [here](http://carlitoswillis.com:2020/).
This version contains my personal collection of Cognitive Science resources.
